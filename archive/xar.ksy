  From Wikipedia:

  "XAR (short for eXtensible ARchive format) is an open source file archiver
  and the archiverâ€™s file format. It was created within the OpenDarwin project
  and is used in macOS X 10.5 and up for software installation routines, as
  well as browser extensions in Safari 5.0 and up."

  It should be noted that there is a different version from Apple uses the
  same version number as the (unmaintained) version described here, but that
  supports additional checksums, but doesn't have checksum_name.
